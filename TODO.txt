- repo tabs should be a mixin somewhere
- repo views should always show the commit that they are working on

- rework raw blob url structure
    /<group>/<repo>/raw/objects/<hex><ext>
        ext allows for sending proper content-type for browsers

- "Files @ HEAD" tab should include the branch/rev

- How do the repo view relate to each other?

    - main repo view is the README, or instructions on how to push to it, like github
    
    Create a new repository on the command line

        touch README.md
        git init
        git add README.md
        git commit -m "first commit"
        git remote add origin git@github.com:mikeboers/sandbox.git
        git push -u origin master
        Push an existing repository from the command line

    Push an existing repository

        git remote add origin git@github.com:mikeboers/sandbox.git
        git push -u origin master

- test the permissions!

- 'group.autocreate' and 'repo.autocreate'

- 'group.create' permission is effectively 'http.post' on 'group_create' entrypoint

- avatars are all from gravatar

- add `update` hook to repos on creation. It is run once for every branch being
  pushed BEFORE they are accepted, allowing us to do write/force/merge control.

    - https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/master/src/lib/Gitolite/Hooks/Update.pm#L110

- read-only HTTP access to the repo. This is a matter of preparing a couple of
  special index files, see:

  http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols#The-Dumb-Protocol

- auth via GitHub, Facebook, passwords, or one-time links which create cookies
  for access to single projects.

- example.com/pypi to give a pip-usable interface using tags.

- be able to mark repos as clones from other locations. Periodically pull them,
  OR respond when they are hit with a webhook from GitHub or a post-recieve hook.
