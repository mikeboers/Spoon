Uses LibGit2, is written in Python on top of Flask, and uses HAML+SASS.

Perhaps replace gitolite as the repo configurator.

    It only seems to hook the .ssh/authorized_keys, and the `update` hook.
    
    The authorized_keys only allows three git commands to get through, and
    makes sure that the repository name is sane. It may also create empty
    repos if the person is allowed to do that. It also controls read access.

    The update hook is run once for every branch being pushed BEFORE they are
    accepted. This allows us to do access control. See:

        - http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks#Server-Side-Hooks
        - https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/master/src/lib/Gitolite/Hooks/Update.pm#L110

    - How is SSH access wrangled?
        - authorized_keys:
            command="bash -c 'env | grep SSH | sort'",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty KEY
        - `ssh -i id_rsa localhost hello`
            SSH_CLIENT=127.0.0.1 54588 22
            SSH_CONNECTION=127.0.0.1 54588 127.0.0.1 22
            SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND=hello

Read-only HTTP access to the repos.
    - This is a matter of preparing a couple of special index files, see:
      http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols#The-Dumb-Protocol

Read-only version of gitolite.
    
    - Description in $repo/description
    - Name of the creator in $repo/gl-creator
    - Extra permissions in $repo/gl-perms

Authentication via GitHub, Facebook, passwords, or one-time links which
create cookies for access to single projects.

example.com/pypi to give a pip-usable interface using tags.

Mark repos as clones from other locations. Periodically pull them, OR respond
when they are hit with a webhook from GitHub or a post-recieve hook.

        database
