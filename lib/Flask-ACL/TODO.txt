Figure out what to do about ANY/ALL.

ACLs on groups and repos, where:
    - OWNER is the owner
    - MEMBER is members of the group (or repo's group)
    - ANY is anyone


Put the predicate context onto a Flask stack proxy?

    from flask.ext.acl import predicate_context


@flask.ext.acl.register_permission
    use for:
        delete -> delete, write, read
        write -> write, read
        read -> read


@flask.ext.acl.register_predicate
