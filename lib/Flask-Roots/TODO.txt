- gem/node commands

- replace baker with argparse in manage and migrate
  - roots.command.Command class provides argument setup and the final function

- manage install

- MANAGE_COMMANDS be a list of entrypoints for other commands

- migrate create 'name of new patch'
- migrate upgrade

- get Roots into template path
- get Roots into static path, maybe; this may not be nessesary since others can
  register blueprints which provide their own static folders

- be able to set FLASK_INSTANCE_PATH


- It will provide an easy mechanism for Python/Ruby/Node/general packages, but
  won't actually administer them itself.

  roots {pip,gem,npm,bower} {install,freeze}
  roots packages freeze -> freeze them all
  roots packages install -> install from etc/{pip,gem,npm,bower}-requirements.txt

- configuration decorators:

    @provides('logging')
    @requires('ADMINS')
    def setup_logging(config):
        config.setdefault('LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL', logging.INFO)
        for admin in config.get('ADMINS', []):
            # Setup email logger.
            pass

    -- OR --

    @defer(requires='ADMINS', provides='logging')
    def setup_logging(config):
        pass

    @defer(priority=500)
    def _something(config):
        pass

- subcommands via argparse. flask_roots.commands package will be walked looking
  for `register_command` functions.

- base commands for fabric in flask_roots.fabric.exports:
    in manage.py: from flask.ext.roots.fabric.exports import *

- for path in flask_roots.utils.iter_resources('etc/*-requirements.txt', instance_first=True):
    iterate across the various paths: roots/etc, app/etc, app/var/etc

    Find these via FLASK_INSTANCE_PATH, FLASK_ROOT_PATH, and relative to flask_roots
    (via the root_path on the Flask-Roots Blueprint).

    This is very similar to `Flask.open_instance_resource(path)`.
